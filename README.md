# Beginner Hacking Series
## What is this?
* This git repo is meant to organize all of the files and DOCS which go hand-in-hand with the tutorial series on Youtube.
## What are some prerequisites?
- **Intermediate knowledge about programming**, you should be able to understand and implement:
  - Conditional Statements / Control flow
  - Functions/Methods and Return statements
  - For/While/Do While Loops
- Windows Machine if you want to follow along (highly recommended), but some tools work on other OS's
- A good work ethic and **patience**, this stuff takes some getting used to!
- Overall willingness to **push oneself**, there is likely a lot of new information if you are unfamiliar with low level programming and reverse engineering.

## What this will include
- An introduction to how memory works in a computer, and how to "mess" with it for our personal gain.
- An introduction to hacking tools: **Cheat Engine, Ghidra, ReClass.NET, and Hex Editors.**
- Sources to delve deeper than a video series can provide, ***docs are immensely important!***
- A space to learn and ask questions about video game hacking and modding!

## What this will NOT include
- How to bypass Anticheat. You first have to learn how to hack, only then can you move to modern games.
- Complete beginner programming hand holding. You're assumed to have some working knowledge of a computer and computer programming. However, I will point you to sources and DOCS, you will not be assumed to know everything beforehand.

## Current Video Schedule (apt to change)
### 1. Finding Values with Cheat Engine
  - Brief setup, then simplified explanation of memory in a computer.
  - What is memory? How is it stored?
  - Data Types / Numeric representations
### 2. Pointers, Pointer Maps, and Persistant Data
  - What is a pointer?
  - How are they used?
  - How are they represented in memory?
  - What purpose do they serve me as a game hacker?
  - Basic Entity Struct
### 3. Basic Assembly & Nop Patching
  - Intel vs. At&t syntax
  - Operands & Opcodes
  - Basic Operations: MOV, ADD, SUB
  - Branching Operations: JMP, JE, CMP, JG, JL, etc.
### 4. More Assembly, the Stack, and Patching
  - Calling conventions
  - Cheat Engine's Auto Assemble
  - A stack of what, you say?
  - It "grows," how?
  - More Operations: PUSH, POP, LEA
### 5. Increasing Movement Speed / Break and Trace
  - Using break and trace to find values and function calls
  - Using an auto-assemble script to change max velocity
  - Change Camera too?
### 6. Entity Lists / Entity List Pointers
  - What is that?
  - How to find them / What do they look like in memory?
  - What are they good for / What can I do with them?
  - Using Reclass.NET
### 7. Reverse Engineering the Entity Class
  - How to find which values do what?
  - Cheat Engine: Creating Adresses/Labels from code and structs (ReClass)
  - Entity Types? Finding Strings in Ghidra
### more to come...
